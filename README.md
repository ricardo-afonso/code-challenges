[Challenge 406](challenge_406.js)

- Create a function to partition a list from left to right.
- With an n input, your output should be a list containing n-1 sublists. Each sublist should have two elements: the left and the right side of the partition (both should be non-empty, unless the input list is empty).
An empty list should return an empty list: []


[Challenge 407](challenge_407.js)

- Create a function that sums the total number of digits between two numbers, inclusive. For example, between the numbers 19 and 22 we have:

  ```
  [19, 20, 21, 22]
  (1 + 9) + (2 + 0) + (2 + 1) + (2 + 2) = 19`
  ```

[Challenge 408](challenge_408.js)

 - A Happy Year is any year with only distinct digits. Create a function that takes an integer year and returns the next happy year.

[Challenge 409](challenge_409.js)

 - Create a function that takes a fraction as an argument and returns half of it. Eg. 1/2 - 1/4s
